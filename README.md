# About

This is my website, that I first created just to try making a website. First it had a dark pink forum-like(?) theme. After that I started introducing myself to javascript and then decided to make it a cmd wannabe. Currently it is just a random site where i put my stuff.

# Themes

~~Currently accepting custom themes.
Themes are defined in the `styles.css` file and use 3 colors currently: main, bg and bg2.
Main is for the text color, bg is the background color and bg2 is currently not used.~~

~~A theme looks like this:
```
.theme-name
{
    --main: #fff;
    --bg: #000;
    --bg2: rgb(66,66,66);
}
```~~
~~A color definition can take hex or predefined colors by default, but also rgb with the rgb(r,g,b) function. Currently theme names also have to be added to the `commandHandler.js` file to the `themes` array, so they are recognized. I plan on auto-recognizing themes from the `styles.css`.~~
